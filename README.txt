Portfolio Website

This portfolio is a consolidated showcase of my work as an AI/ML Engineer. It focuses on the core areas that matter: the projects I’ve built, the skills I actually use, and the experience that defines my technical direction. The goal is straightforward—give recruiters, engineers, and collaborators a clean, structured view of what I can do and how I think.
