                    <h2>My Journey</h2>
                </header>

                <p>From a young age, I was drawn to science and challenging problems. Mathematics became my anchor early on, and after scoring 96 in Maths in 12th, I chose B.Tech in Computer Science with a clear intention to work in technology.</p>

                <p>Joining my college’s technical club, Solareon, exposed me to Arduino, programming, and the thrill of building things from scratch. That experience pushed me toward a bigger question: follow the conventional academic route or dive into the emerging world of AI and Machine Learning. I chose the harder and more uncertain path.</p>

                <p>I discovered ML/AI in 2019, and during the lockdown the following year, the exploration turned into commitment. With uninterrupted time and relentless curiosity, I began building projects, experimenting, and understanding the foundations of intelligent systems. This journey led me to two internships where I applied my learning, refined my skills, and built real solutions.</p>

                <p>What has stayed constant throughout is my drive to learn deeply and apply practically. That mindset — curiosity, discipline, and the willingness to choose the harder road — is what shaped my path into AI/ML Engineering and continues to guide my work today.</p>
